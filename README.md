ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas Gurr

  I am a self-taught software developer, who is currently looking for a front-end job.
  
  I have taken Udemy courses, and have gone through many video tutorials to learn the ins and outs of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
  
  I am currently learning React, and am building a website with it right now.
